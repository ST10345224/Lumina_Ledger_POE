### âœ¨Features
- **Detailed Dashboard:** Easily view your monthly expenses on a descriptive pie chart, illustrating how much you have spent in each category as well as the spending goals you have set for yourself. 
- **Categories:** You can add categories to better organize your expenses, by also being able to set an icon for quality of life.
- **Ledger View:** Allows you to view all of your expenses in detail from just one page! If wish to view a particular expense in detail, you simply tap on the expense's card to view information such as its description or picture. This view also contains the total amount that you have spent.
- **Setting Goals:** Easily track your monthly spending habits by setting goals. To set a goal, you simply select the month, set the minimum and maximum values - essentially setting a budget range to stay within for said month. There is also a progress bar present to assist you in managing your spending.
- **Adding Expenses:** Whereas, the Ledger is where you can view all of your expenses, the *New Expenses* view is where you can add them in the first place. To add an expense, you simply enter a title, select a category and currency, and enter an amount. Additionally, you can also enter a description or add a photo to an expense for later reference. 
- **User Profile:** Last but not least is the *Profile* view where you can view and edit your user information such as your email or profile picture.
